## Reflection Questions

What was your favorite part of this assignment?
- I really enjoyed debugging! Going through the CaesarCipher tests & actually sketching out the arrays & the implementations on a whiteboard was really fun and interesting -- it was the only way I could visualize this particular assignment, but I think I'm going to employ this strategy more going forward. 

What was most challenging about this assignment?
- Figuring out the Gradle & GitHub classroom interface, making sure it commits & pushes, building the code with Gradle

General comments on your experience with this assignment:
- It was pretty daunting / challenging at first and I didn't really know where to start but I just kept coding and eventually figured it out!
